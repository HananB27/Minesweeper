# Minesweeper MATLAB App Report

## Overview
The provided MATLAB code defines a Minesweeper game using the MATLAB App Designer. The game includes a graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons representing the Minesweeper grid, a counter for the remaining bombs, and various controls for gameplay.

## Structure and Components
The Minesweeper app consists of the following components:

- `MinesweeperUIFigure`: The main MATLAB figure for the Minesweeper game.
- `WelcometoMinesweeperLabel`: A label displaying a welcome message (not utilized in the provided code).
- `panel1`: A container panel that holds the Minesweeper grid and other components.
- `Minefield`: A grid layout within `panel1` where Minesweeper buttons are placed.
- `StartButton`: A button to initiate the Minesweeper game.
- `ChoosedifficultyDropDown`: A dropdown menu for selecting the game difficulty.
- `ChoosedifficultyDropDownLabel`: A label associated with the difficulty dropdown.

## Properties
- `countMines`: A counter for the number of mines.
- `counter`: A counter for the remaining bombs.

## Methods
### `generateBomb`
- Generates the Minesweeper game board based on the selected difficulty.
- Places bombs randomly on the game board.
- Calculates and sets numbers around bombs indicating the number of adjacent bombs.

### `youAreDead`
- Callback function executed when a bomb is clicked.
- Displays a message indicating game over.
- Changes the Smiley button to a dead face.

### `buttonClicked`
- Callback function for button clicks.
- Handles flag placement and non-flag clicks.
- Executes logic based on checkbox state (flag placement).
- Reveals neighboring empty squares and updates the game state.

### `revealEmpty`
- Recursive function to reveal empty cells and their neighboring cells.

### `checkIcon`
- Sets the icon for a button based on its tag value.

### `startupFcn`
- Executes after component creation.
- Initializes app properties, including setting the game panel visibility to 'off'.

## File Paths
The code uses absolute file paths to load images for buttons and icons. These paths should be updated based on the actual file locations on the user's system.

## Conclusion
The provided code creates a functional Minesweeper game using MATLAB App Designer. The code structure is modular, with separate functions for different aspects of the game logic. The use of MATLAB App Designer simplifies the GUI creation and event handling.
